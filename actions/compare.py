# compare and/or group two datasets using their respective parsers and return some groups of data:
# 1. items in the first dataset and not the second
# 2. items in the second dataset and not the first
# 3. items in both datasets (this can maybe be split into two datasets, one for data thats different between the two, and one for data thats the same)
