# GISCorps output

This is an output to translate the results of this script into something that can be submitted to the GISCorps volunteers for inclusion in their [datasets](https://covid-19-giscorps.hub.arcgis.com/). They have a [google docs template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NuTVYoela8e_rXeNlHkE_IBpDxYcOUnnW_OIGV_kcXc/edit?usp=sharing) for submitting data in bulk and [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z8wCoA91asxuvNmZ4Nsb-4IF8jKyZeUKVyRpUr4Xef8/edit) on what should go in each field and what the limits (max characters, etc.) are.

Output probably doesnt neeed to be in a google doc specifically, but a CSV or spreadsheet of a similar format would probably suffice
